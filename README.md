# Ada Conversations API Demo

This is a demo project providing a minimal implementation of a frontend to interact with an [Ada](https://ada.cx) bot via the Ada Conversations API.

To learn more about Ada's Conversations API visit the [developer docs](https://developers.ada.cx/reference/conversations/overview).

# How to Run this Demo

## Environment Setup

Clone this repo and `cd` into it.

If using a virtual env, create one and activate it:

```
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Install dependencies:
```
pip install -e .
```

## Network Setup

Ada needs to be able to reach the machine that this demo is running on via webhook. The simplest way to manage this locally is with something like [ngrok](https://https://ngrok.com/). There are other possible ways of achieving this but for simplicity we'll assume use of ngrok:

In a new terminal window, start an ngrok http tunnel to port `8080` 

```
ngrok http 8080
```

Take note of the forwarding address. It may be something like `https://1234-56-78-90.ngrok-free.app`

## Bot Configuration

### API Key

Navigate to the Ada dashboard and go to `Platform -> APIs` and create a new API Key. Copy it and save it for later.

### Webhook Configuration

Again in the Ada dashboard, go to `Platform -> Webhooks` and add a new endpoint. The endpoint URL should be the forwarding address from the `Network Setup` section above *PLUS* `/webhooks/message` appended to it (if using ngrok, then possibly something like `https://1234-56-78-90.ngrok-free.app/webhooks/message`). In the "Subscribe to events" section, make sure you subscribe to all `v1.conversation` events.

Once created, copy and save the `Signing Secret` value.

### Custom Channel Creation

We need to create a custom channel. To create a custom channel in production, we can use the following cURL command:

```
curl -X 'POST' \
  'https://<bot-handle>.ada.support/api/v2/channels/' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <ada-api-key>' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
  "name": "My Custom Channel",
  "description": "A custom messaging channel for my AI Agent",
  "modality": "messaging",
  "status": "active"
}'
```

Replace `<bot-handle>` with the handle of your bot, and `<ada-api-key>` with the API key generated in the section above. Run the command and note the value for the returned `id` field - this is your custom channel ID

## Putting It All Together

In the base directory of this project, create a `.env` file with the contents:

```
ADA_BASE_URL=your-ada-bot-url
ADA_API_KEY=ada-api-key-you-just-made
ADA_CHANNEL_ID=ada-channel-id-for-custom-channel-you-just-made
WEBHOOK_SECRET=signing-secret-from-endpoint-you-just-added
```

The `ADA_BASE_URL` should be the entire URL to your Ada bot - so something like `https://lovelace.ada.support`

## Running It

Finally, you can run the demo app dashboard by running
```
python run.py
```

and interact with your Ada bot by visiting `http://127.0.0.1:8080` ðŸŽ‰
